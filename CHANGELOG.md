## ALIGNING PATHWAYS

#### 1.1.0 (2022-10-11)

- Started separating the SubstitutionMatrices logic.
- A new contract has been made (SubstitutionMatrices.sol). It's a CRUD for matrices and alphabets, this way matrices become modular.
- Included a bunch of scripts to read matrices, alphabets and interact with the contract (Javascript logic).

#### 1.0.0 (2022-10-08)

- Created the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
